Move
============

This first project teaches how to program movement actions for the PiCar-X. In this project, the program will tell the PiCar-X to execute five actions in order: “forward”, “backward”, “turn left”, “turn right”, and “stop”.

To learn the basic usage of Ezblock Studio, please read through the following two sections:

This block makes PiCar-X move at a certain speed, a percentage of power. Just like "50" is a half-speed.

This block makes your PiCar-X back at a certain speed, which is also a percentage of power.

This block can adjust the front wheels’ orientation. The range is "-45"~"45". Such as "-30" means wheels deviate 30° to the left.

Let PiCar-X stop.
