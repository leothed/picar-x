Welcome to PiCar-X's Documentation!
===================================

Thanks for choosing our PiCar-X.

PiCar-X is an AI self-driving robot car for Raspberry Pi, on which RPi works as the 
control center. The mounted camera module, ultrasonic module, line tracking module 
can separately realize the functions of color detection, face detection, automatic 
obstacle avoidance, automatic line tracking, etc.

In this tutorial, a list, assembly diagram, introduction to Robot HAT, and programming of PiCar-X are included.

The programming part is divided into two chapters: :ref:`Play with Ezblock` & :ref:`Play with Python`, and each of them can get you stated on making PiCar-X work in way you want.

Ezblock Studio is a development platform developed by SunFounder designed for beginners to lower the barriers to getting started with Raspberry Pi. It has two programming languages: Graphical and Python, and available on almost all different types of devices. With Bluetooth and Wi-Fi support, you can download code, remote control a Raspberry Pi, on Ezblock Studio.

If you want to program in Python, then you will need to learn some basic Python programming skills and basic knowledge of Raspberry Pi OS.
